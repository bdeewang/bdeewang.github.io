Throughout my academic journey, I've discovered that mathematics becomes most meaningful when shared with others. Moments of connection and growth fuel my passion for mathematics. I believe deeply in making mathematics more accessible and inclusive, which is why I've devoted considerable time to outreach and service activities.
