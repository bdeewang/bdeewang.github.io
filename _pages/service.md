Throughout my academic journey, I've discovered that mathematics becomes most meaningful when shared with others. Moments of connection and growth fuel my passion for mathematics. I believe deeply in making mathematics more accessible and inclusive, which is why I've devoted considerable time to outreach and service activities.

<p>I am a co-organiser for <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/experiencesinmath/"><b>Experiences in Mathematics</b></a> seminar series, since Spring 2024, where we invite mathematicians, in the broadest sense of the word, to come and discuss their experiences navigating the professional world as members of minoritised and underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>I was an organiser of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/drp-math/"><b>Directed Reading Program</b></a> - where we pair undergraduates with graduate students to work on a reading project - from Fall 2021, when I helped restart the program after a brief hiatus during the pandemic, to March 2025. I have participated as a mentor myself several times, and you can <a href="\drp">view the interesting topics my mentees and I have worked on here</a>.
