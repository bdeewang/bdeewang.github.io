Throughout my academic journey, I've discovered that mathematics becomes most meaningful when shared with others. Moments of connection and growth fuel my passion for mathematics. I believe deeply in making mathematics more accessible and inclusive, which is why I've devoted considerable time to outreach and service activities.

<p>I am a co-organiser for <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/experiencesinmath/"><b>Experiences in Mathematics</b></a> seminar series, since Spring 2024, where we invite mathematicians, in the broadest sense of the word, to come and discuss their experiences navigating the professional world as members of minoritised and underrepresented groups.</p>
