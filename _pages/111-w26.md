<h2 style="color:#9DD49C; margin-bottom:-0.5em;">Fostering a Welcoming Environment</h2>

<p>I strive to create an inclusive space where everyone—regardless of background or identities—can discover, define, and develop their mathematical voice, and feel welcome and valued.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I ask that you engage fully with your peers and the material by reflecting on challenges, asking questions, and encouraging one another. We will all experience struggles as we learn together, and that's a normal part of the process.</p>

<p>When we cause harm, I expect us to listen thoughtfully, apologise sincerely, and commit to growth. Behaviour that undermines another person's sense of belonging has no place in our learning environment. Please speak with me or university officials if you experience or witness discrimination or harassment.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Course Description &amp; Learning Goals</b></summary>
  <p>The main goal in this course is to build your understanding of calculus as the study of <strong>change</strong>, <strong>accumulation</strong>, and the <strong>infinite</strong> (both infinitely big and infinitesimally small).</p>
  <p>By the end of this course, you will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Learn</em> the language of limits and grasp how functions behave as they approach specific values</li>
    <li><em>Know</em> how to use derivatives to capture instantaneous rates of change and <em>calculate</em> derivatives using different techniques</li>
    <li><em>Know</em> how to use derivatives to graph functions and <em>apply</em> your skills to solve optimization problems</li>
    <li>Have a firm grasp on integrals and antiderivatives and <em>know</em> how to calculate definite and indefinite integrals</li>
    <li><em>Connect</em> derivatives and integrals through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</li>
  </ul>

<h2 style="color:#9DD49C; margin-bottom:-0.5em;">Policies &amp; Guidelines</h2>

<details>
  <summary><b>Homework Guidelines</b></summary>
  <p>Please turn in homework on the due date via Gradescope.</p>
  <p><strong>Extensions:</strong> If you need an extension (including late work), please ask <strong>before 7 PM on the due date</strong>. You can receive up to a one-day extension when asked.</p>
  <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> You're encouraged to work on homework with peers, in the MSSC, and during Office Hours—but what you turn in should be in your own words.</p>
  <p>You may consult other textbooks or online sources for clarification of concepts, but <strong>do not seek out solutions</strong> to assigned problems in other texts, materials from previous semesters, or online sources. Using sites like Chegg and Slader is considered academic dishonesty.</p>
  <div class="callout-quarto tip">
    <div class="callout-title">If You're Tempted to Seek Solutions</div>
    <div class="callout-content">
      <p>Email me or come to office hours to chat, and/or go to MSSC and work with a friend!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Generative AI Usage Policy</b></summary>
  
  <p><strong>My Philosophy on AI and Learning</strong><br>
  In mathematics, learning comes through practice, productive struggle, and developing your own problem-solving abilities. I want to see your authentic work and thinking process, not AI-generated solutions, because I'm excited to be part of your mathematical journey!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Limitations of AI Tools</strong><br>
  AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can sometimes be useful, but their output contains biases, inaccuracies, and incomplete information. Think of them as that overconfident friend who didn't actually do well in this course. You're responsible for ensuring accuracy, and relying on AI won't prepare you for exams.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Permitted Uses</strong><br>
  <em>I would prefer you email me or visit MSSC before using AI, but these uses are allowed:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conceptual tutoring:</strong> Asking AI to help understand difficult concepts (exercise critical thinking—AI can be oversimplified or wrong)</li>
    <li><strong>Vocabulary clarification:</strong> Looking up individual mathematical terms (you must be able to explain any concept you use)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>You must acknowledge AI use in your submission by including specific prompts used.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Prohibited Uses</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem solving:</strong> Do not use AI to solve homework, provide solutions, or give step-by-step guidance</li>
    <li><strong>Writing assistance:</strong> Do not use AI to brainstorm, outline, draft, or edit your mathematical writing</li>
    <li><strong>Recording/transcription:</strong> Do not use AI tools (like Otter.ai) to record or summarize class meetings, office hours, or lectures</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>If You Suspect You've Violated This Policy</strong><br>
  Please reach out to me immediately. I value honesty and will work with you constructively, focusing on your learning rather than punishment.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Land Acknowledgement</b></summary>
  <p>We stand on the homelands of the Wahpekute and Mdewakanton bands of the Dakota Nation. We honor with gratitude the people who've stewarded the land through the generations and their ongoing contributions to this region. We acknowledge the ongoing injustices that we have committed against the Dakota Nation, and we wish to interrupt this legacy, beginning with acts of healing and honest storytelling about this place.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</b></summary>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/accessibility-resources/">Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR)</a> promotes access and equity for all students of Carleton. OAR collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.</p>
  <p>If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, autism spectrum disorders, chronic health, traumatic brain injury and concussions, vision, hearing, mobility, or speech impairments), please contact <a href="mailto:oar@carleton.edu">oar@carleton.edu</a> to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Religious Accommodations</b></summary>
  <p>Carleton College welcomes diversity of religious beliefs and practices. As your instructor, I am committed to providing equivalent educational opportunities to students of all belief systems.</p>
  <p>If at all possible, please contact me during the first week of classes to discuss any potential conflicts between academic requirements and religious observances. We can work together to determine a reasonable accommodation.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Student Well-Being</b></summary>
  <p>These are stressful times. Your health and well-being should always be your first priority. At Carleton, we have a wide array of resources to support students.</p>
  <p>It's important to recognize stressors you may be facing—personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. Sleep, exercise, and connecting with others can be strategies to help you flourish.</p>
