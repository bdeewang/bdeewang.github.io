If you are requesting a letter of recommendation for a graduate program from me because I've been your instructor in the past, I should mention that it will be better for your application if faculty members write your main three letters of recommendation. I am currently a graduate student, and having a graduate student write a letter of recommendation may carry less weight and may contribute to your application not being the strongest. I am happy to be a fourth/fifth letter writer if the school allows more letters. <em> But if you don't have enough faculty members to turn to, I am happy to be one of the three letter writers.</em><br>

Below is a list of things I strongly prefer having when I write a letter; not everything may be relevant for you!
<ul>
    <li> Please try to let me know at least a <b>month in advance</b>. (I will still try to accomodate shorter deadlines, but the letter is likely to be better if I have more time.) </li>
    <li> A list of links to the <b>instructions/prompt</b> for the letter writer, with deadlines. </li>
    <li> Instructions on <b>how to submit</b> (e.g., email to XXX, "you will receive an email", or send me a link, etc). </li>
    <li> Please also find out things like whether I need to mail a physical letter vs. upload to a web site, if my letter has a different deadline than the rest of your application, and any other special instructions. </li>
    <li> I have a <b>strong preference</b> for PDF or plain text documents. A spreadsheet is also ok but I strongly prefer PDF or plain text. </li>
    <li> Please <b>include your name</b> in the filename of any documents you send me. </li>
    <li> Who are your <b>other letter writers</b>? Include a sentence of context too (e.g., advised my honors thesis). </li>
    <li> Once you have <b>drafts</b> of anything you're submitting please send them to me. The basic principle is that I can't write about something I don't know about. </li>
    <li> If you are an undergraduate, I'd prefer you send an <b>unofficial copy of your transcript</b> too. </li>
</ul>

I leave it up to the applicant to make sure that I don't miss the deadline (something which has never happened so don't worry). I ask that you send me frequent email (every week or more as the deadlines grow closer) to remind me. I won't forget but this keeps it at the top of my to-do list. At some point I will then send you an email back saying that I have mailed/uploaded/etc the letter. If you do not receive confirmation from me, then you should assume that I have not submitted your letter and you should pester me.

Finally, on the application page, please use the following for my personal information.<br>
